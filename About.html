	 <h1> My high school days </h1>
	 <p> First of all, I would like to introduce myself. I am Anjishnu Kundu. I completed
	 	my class 10th from St.Xavier's School,Durgapur. Thereafter, I have completed my 
	 	class 12th from DAV Model School,Durgapur and then got admission into my dream institute
	 	IIT Kharagpur.
	 </p>
	 <h1> My JEE and college days </h1>
	 <p> As all of my peers, I too got into one of the coaching institute FIITJEE Durgapur.
	 	 At first, it was difficult to manage both coaching and schooling but somehow I was
	 	 able to manage it later and finally, cleared both JEE mains and Advanced with a 
	 	 pretty decent rank which got me into where I am now i.e. IIT Kharagpur.
	 </p>
	 <p> Getting into college, of course in these pandemic times, thrashed all my hopes together. 
	 	 It has been a difficult task for me to study online as well. But then, all we can wait 
	 	 for is to reopen IITKGP.
